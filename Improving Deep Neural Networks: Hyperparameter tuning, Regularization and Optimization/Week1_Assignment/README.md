The week one assignment shows how to improve deep neural networks using systematic approach of weights initialization and various regularization techniques which include L2 norm regularization and Drop out technique. It also include an ipynb file showing how to check for the correctness of the computed gradient to fix bugs in back prop code. It is important to note that this file directory consist of just three ipython notebooks and the rest of the files present are datasets and all depenencies/utility files required  for the completion of the aforementioned three ipython notebooks.
