In this week's assignment, I was able to build a step by step DNN and the network model was also applied to classify cat vs non-cat images which first gave an accuracy of 72% with a 2-layer NN and an accuracy of 80% with a 4-layer NN which is better than that of LR. The .py file included in this directory are the necessary utilities/packages that were imported and used in the course of the developing the DNN. The .h5 file are the datasets and can be viewed using HDFViewer.
