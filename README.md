This is a repository containing various ipynb files for a 5 course Deep Learning series by Andrew NG  on Coursera. It is important to know that the purpose of uploading these file is not to mindlessly dub the assignments without having tried it out yourself but to create a shareable track record for myself and educate others who seek such knowledge.
